```lrc
[00:23.27] The first day of spring, the city's feeling brand new
[00:27.06] No shade at Pitti, the people spilling out
[00:30.84] I can't believe I haven't thought about you
[00:37.16] Open the streets, no looking in the rearview
[00:41.61] Sixty degrees, but we can take it off
[00:45.56] I can't believe I haven't thought about you
[01:07.06] 
[00:51.98] It's time to leave, you went cold as winter
[00:55.56] And with one final breeze, both of you let go of me
[00:59.35] I'm starting to see
[01:00.93] Everything looks better now
[01:14.43] 
[01:06.34] Replacing the scenes
[01:08.50] Done self-deprеcating till I burst at the seams
[01:12.08] It's all feeling differеnt, but I know that it's me
[01:15.84] And everything feels better now
[01:31.34] 
[01:20.49] I can't believe
[01:27.73] I can't believe
[01:35.23] 
[01:37.18] Called all of my friends
[01:38.51] That I can fit in one room
[01:40.66] Testing my speakers
[01:42.25] Like they have never been used
[01:44.46] Now I can breathe when I think about you
[01:51.72] It's getting late
[01:53.15] And I've been drinking for two
[01:55.33] Shelving the memories that were colored by you
[01:59.12] Now I can breathe when I think about you
[02:19.12] 
[02:05.64] It's time to leave, you went cold as winter
[02:09.50] And with one final breeze, both of you let go of me
[02:12.91] I'm starting to see
[02:14.81] Everything looks better now
[02:28.31] 
[02:20.52] Replacing the scenes
[02:22.43] Done self-deprecating 'til I burst at the seams
[02:26.00] It's all feeling different, but I know that it's me
[02:29.48] And everything feels better now
[02:44.98] 
[02:36.57] I can't believe, I can't believe
[02:39.85] I can't believe, I can't believe
[02:43.30] I can't believe, I can't believe
[02:46.63] I can't believe
[02:54.13] 
[02:49.44] I can't believe
